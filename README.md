# RockPaperScissorsGame

To learn a language, it is best to speak. In a similar sense, to learn a coding language, it is best to do mini projects and learn to use it. This game will be the first of many where I do mini challenges and code them in Python. While doing this I learned how to run test after each major conditional statement, how to make flow chart to map the logic and how to not get frustrated with myself when I don't get something on the first try.
